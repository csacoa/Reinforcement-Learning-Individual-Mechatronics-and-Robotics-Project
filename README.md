# Reinforcement-Learning-Individual-Mechatronics-and-Robotics-Project
Optimizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms using Stable Baselines package to solve problems in OpenAI gym environments. Benchmarking different algorithms to determine optimal hyperparameters and strategies.
Look in the GIFS folder for examples of what the environments look like after varying amounts of training
